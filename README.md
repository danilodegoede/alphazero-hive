# alphazero-hive

This repository contains an implementation of the self-play based reinforcement learning algorithm for the game of Hive.
It is based on DeepMind's paper on AlphaGo Zero, which can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.pdf).
The self-play based engine builds upon the [AlphaZero General framework] (https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general).
The engine uses [Beekeeper](https://github.com/Fjf/hive_engine/) for the game logic, an optimized implementation of Hive by Duncan Kampert.
Both frameworks have been extended and modified to efficiently work together.
